.# Abstract

A simple, implicit method for media players to automatically load soundfont files when playing MIDI files, enhancing the playback experience without requiring user configuration.

# MIDI Soundfont Sidecar specification

* **Level:** 0
* **Version:** 0.5

1. **Sidecar File Detection:**

- **Primary:** Media players SHOULD first look for a soundfont sidecar file (=with the exact same name) as the MIDI file (excluding the file extension).
- **Fallback:** If a soundfont file is not detected, media players **SHOULD** then look for other soundfont sidecar files with the same naming convention

> Fallback order: `.SF2` > `.SF3` > `.SFZ` > `.DLS`

> NOTE: a mediaplayer-engine does not have to support all soundfont-fileformats to be spec-compliant. Supporting the lowest common denominator (`.SF2` in 2025) is enough.

3. **Example**

Here's a fictional music-album, based on midi- and soundfont-files:

```
$ cd album 
$ ls

drwxr-xr-x   2 leon users  4096 Jun 20 21:39 .
drwxrwxrwt 295 root root  94208 Jun 20 21:39 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 leon users   200 Jun 20 21:38 song1.mid
-rw-r--r--   1 leon user  10000 Jun 20 21:38 song1.sf2
-rw-r--r--   1 leon users   200 Jun 20 21:38 song2.mid
lrwxrwxrwx   1 leon users     9 Jun 20 21:39 song2.sf2 -> song1.sf2

$ mediaplayer song1.mid
```

> the mediaplayer will scan for the soundfont in the same directory (`song1.sf2` e.g.), and use that instead of the global configured soundfont. 

2. **File Naming Convention:**

- The sidecar file MUST have the same name as the MIDI file, differing only by the file extension (`.DLS` or `.SF2` e.g.).
- **Example:**
 - `mysong.mid` â†’ `mysong.SF2` (primary) or `mysong.SFZ` (fallback e.g.)

> Soundfont file-extensions are **case-insensitive** (valid: `.sf2` or `.SF2` or `.Sf2` e.g.)

3. **Playback Behavior:**

- Upon finding a matching sidecar file, the media player SHOULD load the soundfont from this file for the duration of the MIDI file playback.
- If no sidecar file is found, the media player SHOULD fall back to its default soundfont or configured soundfont settings.
- symlinked (or windows junctioned) soundfonts should be allowed (to preserve space)

4. **Implementation Notes:**

- This spec is designed to be lightweight and easy to implement, encouraging broad adoption across various media players and platforms.
- Implementors are encouraged to provide an option for users to override this behavior if desired (e.g., always using a default soundfont, disabling sidecar loading).

5. **Relation to RMIDI and Other Formats:**

- This specification might serve as an 'override' feature for [RMIDI](https://github.com/spessasus/sf2-rmidi-specification) files, allowing users to play [RMID](https://github.com/spessasus/sf2-rmidi-specification) content with a custom soundfont without re-encoding.
- It is format-agnostic, meaning it can be applied to various MIDI file formats beyond [RMID](https://github.com/spessasus/sf2-rmidi-specification).

**Adoption and Feedback:**

- Implementors and interested parties are invited to provide feedback and suggestions for future revisions.
- A list of adopting media players and software will be maintained to track the spec's ecosystem impact.

**Revision History:**

- **v0.5:** Initial release.

---

**Next Steps:**

1. **Review and Feedback:** Circulate this draft among the mentioned projects (VLC-player, fluidsynth, etc.) and relevant communities for feedback.
2. **Revision (if necessary):** Based on the feedback received, revise the spec to better meet the needs of implementors and users.
3. **Publication and Promotion:** Publish the finalized spec on a dedicated webpage or within relevant developer resources, and promote it across music tech, developer, and open-source communities.
