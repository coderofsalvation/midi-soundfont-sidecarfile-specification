Abstract

   A simple, implicit method for media players to automatically load
   soundfont files (.DLS or.SF2) when playing MIDI files, enhancing the
   playback experience without requiring user configuration.

1.  MIDI Soundfont Sidecar specification

   *  *Level:* 0
   *  *Version:* 1.0

   1.  *Sidecar File Detection:*

   *  *Primary:* Media players SHOULD first look for a .DLS sidecar file
      with the exact same name as the MIDI file (excluding the file
      extension).
   *  *Fallback:* If a .DLS file is not found, media players SHOULD then
      look for a .SF2 sidecar file with the same naming convention.

   2.  *File Naming Convention:*

   *  The sidecar file MUST have the same name as the MIDI file,
      differing only by the file extension (.DLS or .SF2).
   *  *Example:*
      -  mysong.mid â†’ mysong.DLS (primary) or mysong.SF2 (fallback)

   3.  *Playback Behavior:*

   *  Upon finding a matching sidecar file, the media player SHOULD load
      the soundfont from this file for the duration of the MIDI file
      playback.
   *  If no sidecar file is found, the media player SHOULD fall back to
      its default soundfont or configured soundfont settings.

   4.  *Implementation Notes:*

   *  This spec is designed to be lightweight and easy to implement,
      encouraging broad adoption across various media players and
      platforms.
   *  Implementors are encouraged to provide an option for users to
      override this behavior if desired (e.g., always using a default
      soundfont, disabling sidecar loading).

   5.  *Relation to RMID and Other Formats:*

   *  This specification might serve as an 'override' feature for RMID
      files, allowing users to play RMID content with a custom soundfont
      without re-encoding.

   *  It is format-agnostic, meaning it can be applied to various MIDI
      file formats beyond RMID.

   *Adoption and Feedback:*

   *  Implementors and interested parties are invited to provide
      feedback and suggestions for future revisions.
   *  A list of adopting media players and software will be maintained
      to track the spec's ecosystem impact.

   *Revision History:*

   *  *v0.5:* Initial release.

   *Next Steps:*

   1.  *Review and Feedback:* Circulate this draft among the mentioned
       projects (VLC-player, fluidsynth, etc.) and relevant communities
       for feedback.
   2.  *Revision (if necessary):* Based on the feedback received, revise
       the spec to better meet the needs of implementors and users.
   3.  *Publication and Promotion:* Publish the finalized spec on a
       dedicated webpage or within relevant developer resources, and
       promote it across music tech, developer, and open-source
       communities.
